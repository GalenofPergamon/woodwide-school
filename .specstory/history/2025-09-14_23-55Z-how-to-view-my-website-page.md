I'm currently evaluating the simplest path to present the website. Given the files' location, I've settled on Python's built-in `http.server`. It seems the most expedient solution for a local preview.


**Defining Server Startup Logic**

I've decided on the approach: First, verify Python. Then, pick port 8000, as it's a likely candidate. Next, the command: `python3 -m http.server 8000`. This will be presented. Finally, I'll execute the server command in the background.
